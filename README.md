# Learning Flask

![ebook_cover](images/flask.png)

With a growing skills gap, the need for talented developers is greater than ever before. A basic grounding in building apps with a framework as minimalistic, powerful, and easy-to-learn as Flask will be a useful skill to launch you on a career as an entrepreneur or web developer. Flask is a Python micro-framework that makes web application development as easy as saying it.

This course will give you a basic grounding in the fundamental concepts of web development, as well as the hands-on experience you require to successfully build web apps with Flask.

We'll start by turning your computer into a modern development machine. Next, we'll move beyond static websites and develop a powerful database-backed dynamic Flask app. We won't stop there, because we'll also cover how to implement a full authentication system.

Finally, we'll extend the app's functionality by learning how to integrate it with third-party APIs.

When you finish this course, you will be fully equipped to build your very own custom web apps.
